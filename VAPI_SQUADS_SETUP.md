### Step 2: Configure Squad Settings

In your VAPI dashboard, create a Squad with these settings:

```json

      "browse": "follow-up-agent-assistant-id"
    },
    "salesAgent": {
      "testDrive": "test-drive-coordinator-assistant-id",
      "financing": "finance-specialist-assistant-id",
      "escalate": "sales-manager-assistant-id"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Configure Background Sounds

```json
{
  "backgroundSounds": {
    "office": "https://your-domain.com/office-ambience.mp3",
    "showroom": "https://your-domain.com/showroom-ambience.mp3", 
    "testDrive": "https://your-domain.com/road-ambience.mp3"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Voice Configuration

Configure each assistant with appropriate voice settings:

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "provider": "elevenlabs",
    "voiceId": "appropriate-voice-id",
    "backgroundSound": "office",
    "backchanneling": true,
    "fillerInjection": true,
    "emotionDetection": true
  }
}
```

## ðŸš€ API Endpoints

### Squad Configuration
```bash
GET https://vapi-dealership-demo-production.up.railway.app/squads/config
```

### Squad Webhook
```bash
POST https://vapi-dealership-demo-production.up.railway.app/squads/webhook
```

### Transfer Function

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Analytics

The system tracks:
- Transfer history between agents
- Conversation context preservation
- Agent performance metrics
- Customer journey mapping
- Resolution rates by agent type

## ðŸ”„ Transfer Logic

The system automatically determines the next agent based on:
- Customer intent (buy, browse, test drive, finance)
- Urgency level (high, medium, low)
- Customer type (qualified, prospect, VIP)
- Conversation stage (initial, consultation, closing)

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

1. **Context Preservation:** All conversation history is maintained during transfers
2. **Seamless Handoffs:** Transfers feel natural and professional
3. **Specialized Expertise:** Each agent focuses on their core competency
4. **Escalation Paths:** Clear escalation routes for complex situations
5. **Background Ambiance:** Realistic office/showroom sounds enhance experience

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Test the squad system with these scenarios:

1. **New Customer Journey:**
   - Lead Qualifier â†’ Sales Agent â†’ Test Drive Coordinator â†’ Sales Agent

2. **Financing Focus:**
   - Lead Qualifier â†’ Sales Agent â†’ Finance Specialist â†’ Sales Agent

3. **Escalation Scenario:**
   - Lead Qualifier â†’ Sales Agent â†’ Manager â†’ Sales Agent

4. **Follow-up Scenario:**
   - Lead Qualifier â†’ Follow-up Agent â†’ Sales Agent

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcomes

- **Improved Customer Experience:** Specialized agents provide better service
